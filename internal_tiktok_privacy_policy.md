Internal Privacy Policy for SosiaFeed (TikTok Feeds)
Effective Date: October 29, 2025
This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to the use of the SosiaFeed application (the "Application") by Authorized Users (personnel of the Licensee Entities). "Licensee Entities" refers to the specific companies, projects, or entities personally authorized by the Developer/Owner under the Internal Access Policy and Terms of Use.
The Application is not public-facing and is designed solely for internal operations of these Licensee Entities, serving the sole purpose of displaying video feeds from authorized TikTok profiles on internal websites.
1. Information Accessed and Processed
The Application adheres to a strict policy of data minimization, accessing only the information necessary to fulfill its stated internal purpose (displaying the feed).
A. Technical Access Data
To function, the Application requires and processes the following technical access data:
1.	TikTok Access Tokens: These tokens are necessary for authenticating API requests to TikTok's services to read the Licensee Entities' designated TikTok account data.
2.	TikTok Profile ID: The unique identifier for the Licensee Entities' designated TikTok profiles.
These tokens and IDs are considered Confidential Company Data and are used only for API authentication. The Developer does not store these tokens or IDs on any external servers or databases controlled by the Developer. They must be securely stored within the Licensee Entities' internal environment.
B. TikTok Profile Data Processed
The Application processes the following data from the Licensee Entities' designated TikTok accounts:
•	Public Video Content: Videos, descriptions, and associated metadata (e.g., creation time, music used, views, likes, shares, comments).
•	Profile Metadata: Profile name, handle, and avatar image URL.
•	Analytics and Metrics: Aggregate performance data related to the Licensee Entities' TikTok content.
This processed data is used exclusively for the internal monitoring, display, and strategic testing purposes defined in the Internal Access Policy.
2. No External User Data Collection
Because SosiaFeed is strictly for internal Licensee Entity use:
•	The Application does not collect, store, or process any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the general public or external TikTok users.
•	The Application does not utilize cookies, tracking pixels, or other third-party mechanisms to gather information from external users.
3. Data Storage and Security
3.1 Data Ownership
All Company Data accessed through the Application remains the sole property of the Licensee Entities.
3.2 Security Responsibilities
The Licensee Entities are solely responsible for ensuring the security of the Technical Access Data (tokens) and Company Data within their internal environment. The Developer provides the Application as a tool but does not take responsibility for the Licensee Entities' data storage and security practices.
